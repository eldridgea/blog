If there's an issue building, go into the themes/hugo-casper-two directory and run 
`git submodule update --init`

For tracking - you'll need to add the tracjer JS into the partials folder inside the theme folder.
I shoudl really fork that git submodule but for now just rmember to add it back in whenever you hav to repull the submodule.
