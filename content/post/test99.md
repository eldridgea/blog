Unlike some of the other metrics I’m diving into, the stock market does affect most Americans directly. In 2017 the Federal Reserve found that 51.9 than half of Americans were invested in the stock market. It’s worth noting that a change in the stock market would have no direct effect on almost half of Americans, but I want to examine that 51.9%. If you’re invested in the market, a change obviously has a direct effect on you, but how much?

Edward N. Wolff’s research has shown that of Americans who own stocks, 84% of the stocks are owned by the country’s richest 10%, meaning that the remaining 16% of stock ownership is spread far more thinly among stockholders. So while market measure are relevant, they are mostly impactful to 10% of Americans, and vary from less impactful to non-impactful for the vast majority of citizens.

So while this is probably the most directly impactful measure in the list of ones I’m covering, its impact is small.
