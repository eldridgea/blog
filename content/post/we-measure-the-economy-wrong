# We Measure the Economy Wrong#

Well, maybe not wrong, but the measurements we use to gauge the economy are increasingly irrelevant to the day-to-day lives when measuring positive effects. 

What I mean by that is that if it’s reported that “the economy” is getting worse you’ll probably feel it personally. It it’s reported that “the economy” is getting better, you may not feel it personally in a significant capacity.

Let’s looks at how we measure the economy today. One thing to keep in mind is that the economy isn’t a thing in and of itself. It’s a model of many different things, the modern model created by Adam Smith in his book The Wealth of Nations in 1776.

There are a variety of ways to measure this model, or sometimes measure parts of it. Some are:

* Consumer spending
* Exchange rate
* Gross domestic product
* GDP per capita
* GNP
* Stock Market
* Interest rate
* Government debt
* Rate of Inflation
* Unemployment
* Balance of Trade

I want to look a bit closet at some of the most common, most trusted, and most cited measurements: GDP, Interest Rate, Stock Market, and Unemployment. 

## GDP
There are two types of GDP measurement, but both attempt to answer the same questions “what is the total dollar value of all final goods and services produced in the country this year”. Final goods and services are ones delivered to the final consumer. So lumber sold to a construction company to build houses isn’t included in the GDP, but lumber sold at to a homeowner for them to use themselves in their own house is.

There are two general methods of measuring GDP - income and and expenditure. Income attempts to answer the GDP question by calculating what sellers received in income and the expenditure method attempts to answer by calculating what consumers spent. 

## Interest Rate
This, at a high level, measures how expensive money is. If you can get a 15 year mortgage on a house that’s $100,000 at 3%, in this scenarios $100,000 “costs” $24,304.70 in interest, as that’s what you'd pay in interest over the life of the loan.

That’s a relatively low cost for money, compared to a 7% rate where your interest costs would be $61,789.09.

## Stock Market
There’s a million and one ways to measure the stock market, but most are done by indices. The Dow Jones is a traditionally used index that measures the prices of large US companies. The S&P 500 is a somewhat more diversified index that attempts to measure more of the market and weights companies based on market cap. There are other but you get the point. 

## Unemployment 
What this measurement means is pretty clear but how the data is gathered is somewhat unintuitive. The data is not gathered from any type of welfare or unemployment payment data, but by a survey sent monthly to approximately 60,000 households. The percentage of respondents that claim they have no job and are actively looking is what determines the unemployment percentage. Respondents who have no job and report to not be actively looking are not included in this percentage.

--
Many of the measure I’ve mentioned are often proxy statistics in that they don’t directly measure what we want to know, but measure something that’s easier to define that we think will indicate the information we’re actually looking for. While this is an extremely useful method in general, if the proxy statistic is too far removed from the root issues, it can be misleading. It’s especially important to remember this when looking to make changes or assess changes that have been made. If a proxy statistic improves that’s great but it doesn't necessarily mean that improvement was seen in the area that matters.

With that in mind let’s talk about how the measures I mentioned above directly  affect most citizens. 

## GDP
The GDP rarely affects the average citizen directly. This is intentional as the GDP is intended to measure the state of a country's economy as a whole. This is useful informations, but it’s direct effect on any individual citizen can vary greatly. Generally the GDP decreasing is seen as bad, as it’s generally indicative of job loss or wages decreasing, and increasing is seen as good as it can be indicative of wage increases and lower unemployment. 
 
However, while these things are related, it’s not necessarily a good measure of how the average person is doing. An example is when an industry is disrupted by a new one, for instance when the coal industry was (and is) disrupted by natural gas, and renewables. New jobs were created, new companies formed and grew, and the economy of America grew as a new industry was born. The GDP has increased in the last decade, in part because of this industry boom. It is reflective of new jobs being created, and unemployment decreasing.

However, the new jobs being created aren’t in the coal industry town. The competition is fierce and unemployment for coal miners rieses. Wages decrease for the remaining miners. Towns based around the coal industry begin dying. New jobs aren’t available in the area, and there are few and decreasing amounts of jobs for that particular skill set in the country. New job training is difficult to come by, or expensive, or both. Almost all coal miners are going through difficulties ranging from wages not rising all the way to losing a job in a dying town with no way to pay rent, and no way to gain skills need to get a new job. 

I am not making any commentary about this particular situation, other than to draw your attention to the fact that this is not really indicated by the GDP. The GDP can indicate how the average citizen is doing but doesn't necessarily do so. 
Interest Rate

Interests rates can affect the average citizen directly, but not as often or as impactfully as might be imagined. One of the single biggest impacts this metric can have is on new borrowers, particularly those purchasing a home. While this definitely will impact new home buyers, the current interest rate will only affect those buying at that point in time.

Not only that, but currently more Americans are renting than at any point in the last 50 years. With most Americans not taking on mortgage debt,the interest rate isn’t directly affecting them. While the interest rate affects real estate investors that need to pass on the costs to their renters, it only affects the investors that are purchasing at that point in time. Renters are paying the passed-on interest rate from the time the owner took a loan to purchase the property, not the present one.

So while this measure is certainly not relevant it only applies to those taking out a loan currently

So while this rate is relevant to some average citizens, it’s not many. In fact, the National Association of Realtors reports that in 2017 approximately 6.12 million homes were sold, and the US Census Bureau reports over 117 million households were in the US in 2016. So the interest rate affected slightly more than 5% of households in the US.

So while this statistic is relevant to those wanting to borrow money, it is a proxy statistic of varying quality for the average citizen. 

## Stock Market
Unlike some of the other metrics I’m diving into, the stock market does affect most Americans directly. In 2017 the Federal Reserve found that 51.9 than half of Americans were invested in the stock market. It’s worth noting that a change in the stock market would have no direct effect on almost half of Americans, but I want to examine that 51.9%. If you’re invested in the market, a change obviously has a direct effect on you, but how much?

Edward N. Wolff’s research has shown that of Americans who own stocks, 84% of the stocks are owned by the country’s richest 10%, meaning that the remaining 16% of stock ownership is spread far more thinly among stockholders. So while market measure are relevant, they are mostly impactful to 10% of Americans, and vary from less impactful to non-impactful for the vast majority of citizens.

So while this is probably the most directly impactful measure in the list of ones I’m covering, its impact is small.

## Unemployment
Unemployment is interesting. In theory, low unemployment means that competition for labor is fierce, and therefore if you’re job hunting during low unemployment numbers it should be relatively easy to get a job. This all seems to hold true however this measure does not cover crucial pieces of information, namely: hours per week worked, wages and benefits.

While unemployment directly affects citizens, how useful the bare percentage is is debatable. Let’s go back to our coal mining example. Let’s say a coal miner was making the average for a starting coal miner (~$60,000). When the miner loses their job, a few results can happen. Let’s say they get a minimum wage  at $7.2 per hour and work full time - their annual income is now just over $15,000.

Let’s look at less “minimum” example. Let’s say they get a job that pays double minimum wage and work 60 hour weeks - their income would come in at approximately $45,240 per year, only about three quarters of what they were previously making.

Another example would be this miner being unable to find full time work, so they take multiple part time jobs. Now they are likely working more that 40 hours a week, perhaps with income comparable to my previous example, but likely have no benefits.

In all of these examples, there is a serious deterioration in the life of the miner (or whichever person lost their job) and it is not reflected at all in the unemployment statistics.
