### Overview

My home AT&T fiber goes down on rare ocassion.
Overall the realibiltiy is pretty high but I wanted to have a failover just in case.
This is my home Intenet connection -- it runs some services, but nothing crucial.
I didn't want to spend a lot of money on this.
I have a pasword for [Xfinity WiFi](https://wifi.xfinity.com/) and my neighbors have an Xfinity hotspot so I decided I wanted to use this.

### Parts and Services
I already had Ubiquiti gear for my home network including a
[Security Gateway](https://store.ui.com/products/unifi-security-gateway). I also had my Xfinity password. 
The only new piece of hardware I got was a [GL.iNET travel router](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073TSK26W).
