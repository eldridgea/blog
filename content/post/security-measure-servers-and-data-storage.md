*This is a brief description of my security practices. I will make several posts and write updates as I make changes.*
#### Servers

I keep my data on a server running [NAS4Free](http://www.nas4free.org/) with one drive of parity. I also have servers running as VMs on a server running [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) and [WebVirtMgr](http://www.webvirtmgr.net).

* On my NAS I only connect via encrypted methods such as AFP and SSH
* On my next upgrade, I will have my NAS encrypt on disk
* I only connect remotely to any of my servers/NAS via SSH or HTTPS
