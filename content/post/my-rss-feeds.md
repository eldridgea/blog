I've had people ask to get all my RSS Feeds. I have a bunch that I check in [Tiny Tiny RSS](http://tt-rss.org/). I've exported an OPML file that can be imported into Tiny Tiny RSS, or other readers.

You can grab it [here](http://reader.naphos.com/opml.php?op=publish&key=be4qx155790d286c20c).

This is mainly technology related feeds, but it also has tons of other stuff in it. You may want to sanitize inputs before blindly importing this.
