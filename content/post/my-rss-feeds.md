*Update: I have now switched from TT-RSS to [Feedly](https://feedly.com)*

I've had people ask to get all my RSS Feeds. I have a bunch that I check in [Tiny Tiny RSS](http://tt-rss.org/). I've exported an OPML file that can be imported into Tiny Tiny RSS, or other readers.

You can grab it [here](/files/feedly.opml).

This is mainly technology related feeds, but it also has tons of other stuff in it. You may want to sanitize inputs before blindly importing this.
