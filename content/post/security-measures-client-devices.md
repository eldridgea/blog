*This is a brief excerpt of my security practices. I will make several posts and write updates as I make changes.*

#### Client Devices

The main security measure I take on my individual devices is to use full disk encryption and not allow anyone else to use the device (unless there is a guest account).

* On Macs I enable FileVault
* On Windows I use BitLocker
* On iOS I enable TouchID/password which encrpyts the device
* On Android I use the **Encrypt Phone** feature

I also install only necessary software, and do regular wipe and resintalls of the OS. I also keep as little personal information as possible on client devices (although this is pretty difficult to do and still have a useful smartphone).
