      <description>This is a brief description of my security practices. I will make several posts and write updates as I make changes.
Servers I keep my data on a server running NAS4Free with one drive of parity. I also have servers running as VMs on a server running KVM and WebVirtMgr.
 On my NAS I only connect via encrypted methods such as AFP and SSH On my next upgrade, I will have my NAS encrypt on disk I only connect remotely to any of my servers/NAS via SSH or HTTPS  Photo Credit: https://www.</description>
