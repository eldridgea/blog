      <description>This is a brief description of my security practices. I will make several posts and write updates as I make changes.
Password Management For password mangement I use LastPass. LastPass has its issues, however it is, in my opinion, the best balance of convenice and security. It encrypts all passwords and syncs the encrypred file to all computers and is only decrypted locally. It has only had two suspected breaches in its history and the company disclosed them and corrected them quickly.</description>
