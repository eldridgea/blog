      <description>I wanted to take a moment and respond to Troy Hunt’s recent post Here&amp;rsquo;s Why [Insert Thing Here] Is Not a Password Killer.
First, I’d like to say that overall I am in strong agreement with the premise of the article. Usability, adoption, lack of friction are all-important when considering a security mechanism, especially something as crucial as authentication, and when considering replacing something as well known as passwords. Not much out there addresses all of these things at once.</description>
