      <description>This week I gave a talk at Ignite Ann Arbor. All of the talks given were fascinating, I definitley recommend them.
I spoke about the effects of outside influences that are increasing how much they affect universites, and how that in turn is affecting students, professors, and administrators. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to see it, the stream is available on YouTube.
The slides are available here.</description>
