      <description>Android 9.0 introduced native suppport for DNS over TLS (DoT). I like blocking ads and trackers on my device, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like rooting or using an always-on VPN. I begain investigating using DoT as a method for adblocking, as Android uses DoT for all DNS requests if it&amp;rsquo;s enabled. I used a combination of off-the-shelf stuff in a docker network to handle this.
The incoming DoT request is handled by Caddy which strips the TLS and forwards it as a standard DNS request within the private Docker network to a container running PiHole.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This is not a product of Cloudflare and is not supported or endorsed by them. 
 I currently use Cloudflare for all my DNS needs. No surprises there, it&amp;rsquo;s awesome!
I recently changed home ISPs and my new one doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer a free static IP. I run several services out of my lab at home. I&amp;rsquo;m the only person that really uses any of the servicesâ€“definitely not a crucial setup with a 99.</description>
