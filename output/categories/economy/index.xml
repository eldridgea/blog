      <description>We measure the economy wrong.
Well, maybe not wrong, but the way we measure the economy is increasingly irrelevant to the day-to-day lives of citizens when attempting to measure positive effects.
If it&amp;rsquo;s reported that &amp;ldquo;the economy&amp;rdquo; is getting worse, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably notice the effects in your personal life. If it&amp;rsquo;s reported that &amp;ldquo;the economy&amp;rdquo; is getting better, you may not be as directly affected.
