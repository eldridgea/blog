      <description>Android 9.0 introduced native suppport for DNS over TLS (DoT). I like blocking ads and trackers on my device, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like rooting or using an always-on VPN. I begain investigating using DoT as a method for adblocking, as Android uses DoT for all DNS requests if it&amp;rsquo;s enabled. I used a combination of off-the-shelf stuff in a docker network to handle this.
The incoming DoT request is handled by Caddy which strips the TLS and forwards it as a standard DNS request within the private Docker network to a container running PiHole.</description>

      <description>We measure the economy wrong.
Well, maybe not wrong, but way we measure the economy is increasingly irrelevant to the day-to-day lives of citizens when attempting to measure positive effects.
If it&amp;rsquo;s reported that &amp;ldquo;the economy&amp;rdquo; is getting worse, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably notice the effects in your personal life. If it&amp;rsquo;s reported that &amp;ldquo;the economy&amp;rdquo; is getting better, you may not be as directly affected.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how we measure the economy today.</description>

      <description>I wanted to take a moment and respond to Troy Hunt’s recent post Here&amp;rsquo;s Why [Insert Thing Here] Is Not a Password Killer.
First, I’d like to say that overall I am in strong agreement with the premise of the article. Usability, adoption, lack of friction are all-important when considering a security mechanism, especially something as crucial as authentication, and when considering replacing something as well known as passwords. Not much out there that addresses all of these things at once.</description>

      <description>This week I gave a talk at Ignite Ann Arbor. All of the talks given were fascinating, I definitley recommend them.
I spoke about the effects of outside influences that are increasing how much they affect universites, and how that in turn is affecting students, professors, and administrators. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to see it, the stream is available on YouTube.
The slides are available here.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This is not a product of Cloudflare and is not supported or endorsed by them. 
 I currently use Cloudflare for all my DNS needs. No surprises there, it&amp;rsquo;s awesome!
I recently changed home ISPs and my new one doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer a free static IP. I run several services out of my lab at home. I&amp;rsquo;m the only person that really uses any of the services–definitely not a crucial setup with a 99.</description>

      <description>Update: Added diagrams for an example
If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with asymmetric or public key cryptography, a good introduction without the math is available here.
In the wake of the Equifax breach, there&amp;rsquo;s increasing discussion about making changes to Social Security Numbers. Any changes will need to be discussed and will take a long time to implement, but the discussion is overdue. I doubt that there will be any perfect solutions for a while, but the discussion is important.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to having freeipa-client available in dnf or apt repos, so I&amp;rsquo;ve rarely setup clients manually. However, I did today in Raspbian on my Raspberry Pi. I wanted to document it here mainly for my own memory. It was extremely straightforward but there were a couple tweaks needed. (In this doc &amp;ldquo;example.com&amp;rdquo; replaces my domain).
On the Pi install sssd, libnss-sss, libpam-sss, openssh-server krb5-user, and krb5-config.

      <description>I have a hypervisor to run my VMs at home and I decided to finally rollout LDAP and Kerberos using FreeIPA.
I wanted to completely remove local login options, but this presented a minor problem - I wanted to make sure that if my LDAP server was down for any reason, I would still be able to access and troubleshoot priority systems. I login to systems via certificate but my sudo commands now require LDAP.</description>

      <title>The Myth of the Necessary Jerk</title>

      <guid>/2017/04/11/the-myth-of-the-necessary-jerk/</guid>
      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a prevailing myth in popular culture and the tech industry (and others I&amp;rsquo;m sure) of the &amp;ldquo;Necessary Jerk&amp;rdquo; - a jerk who is so singularly gifted in their field that they&amp;rsquo;re completely irreplaceable.
There are numerous examples spread across TV, movies, and books: Gregory House, Tony Stark, Sherlock Holmes, Shawn Spencer, and Granny Weatherwax to name a few.
While it is entertaining to watch Benedict Cumberbatch berate a bewildered Martin Freeman, or Hugh Laurie prank Lisa Edelstein, this prevalent “Necessary Jerk” persona seems to contribute to the collective belief that we have to hire or accommodate these people in the workplace simply because they are providing a unique service.</description>

      <description>I am currently serving all the things out of my home from behind my &amp;ldquo;Golden Gate proxy,&amp;rdquo; which is a combination of an nginx reverse proxy, an SSH WebSocket proxy, and an SSH bastion host.
My Golden Gate services are on their own dedicated VM, separate from the VMs running my actual services. I use the Certbot (previously Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt), &amp;ldquo;webroot&amp;rdquo; plugin which places some verification files at $DOMAIN/.well-known. However with a reverse proxy, there needs to be speical configuration section so that the .</description>

      <title>SSH Relay for ChromeOS</title>

      <guid>/2016/02/28/proxy-ssh-for-chromeos/</guid>
      <description>I am a fairly heavy user of ChromeOS. Most of my &amp;ldquo;actual work&amp;rdquo; is done on my server so ChromeOS makes for a great laptop OS for me. However it is not compatible with my &amp;ldquo;Golden Gate&amp;rdquo; SSH setup as the Secure Shell extension for Chrome does not support ProxyCommand. There is a relay option that is used internally at Google that is unfortunately not open sourced.
However, I was able to find a reverse engineered relay server.</description>

      <description>I would like my videos to be ready to be moved to mobile devices when I want to travel, and things like Plex take too long for my liking. However I also prefer retaining the original full quality videos.
I wrote a Bash script (intended to be run as a cron job) that watches a directory for new files, and converts them to a ~3GB file with ffmpeg and dumps them in a destination directory.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make everything I do online as secure as possible, while compromizing my expereince as little as possible. The most significant choice here is my web browser.
I rotate between a lot of them because none of the realistic options I&amp;rsquo;ve found meet all of my requirements.
Requirements:  Open source Tab sandboxing Supports Privacy Badger, uBlock, and HTTPS Everywhere (or equivalent feature set)  Preferred:  Automatic updates Cross platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android) U2F support LastPass support    FOSS Sandboxing Privacy Extensions   Chrome No Yes Yes   Chromium Yes Yes Yes   Firefox Yes No Yes   Opera No Unknown Not all   Safari No Yes No   Edge No Unknown No   So, Chromium meets my security requirements, but it&amp;rsquo;s unrealistic for a few reasons:</description>

      <description>In addition to my Golden Gate proxy providing security for web requests, I needed it to assist in securing SSH requests as well. SSH is already as secure as I need it, but I wanted to avoid exposing my servers directly to the Internet.
For my internal services I added this to the ~/.ssh/config file on my laptop (replace USERNAME and PROXY_IP as appropriate):
Host *.naphos.com User USERNAME ProxyCommand ssh -q -x USERNAME@PROXY_IP -W %h:%p  This makes any SSH or SFTP request from my laptop to internal.</description>

      <description>I have a rudimenatry Golden Gate proxy up and running using nginx reverse proxies. I have included the configuration file (from /etc/nginx/sites-enabled) I used to protect my Sickbeard installation.
The first server section forces a redirect from an http connection to an https one.
The second server section listens for https connections using the certificates declared. I didn&amp;rsquo;t use signed certificates as I am the only person that uses most of the services I host.</description>

      <description>Update: I have now switched from TT-RSS to Feedly
I&amp;rsquo;ve had people ask to get all my RSS Feeds. I have a bunch that I check in Tiny Tiny RSS. I&amp;rsquo;ve exported an OPML file that can be imported into Tiny Tiny RSS, or other readers.
You can grab it here.
This is mainly technology related feeds, but it also has tons of other stuff in it. You may want to sanitize inputs before blindly importing this.</description>

      <description>This is a brief description of my security practices. I will make several posts and write updates as I make changes.
Two-Factor Authentication I enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. I use multiple apps to do this, but I usually use Google Authenticator&amp;rsquo;s TOTP. I have this enabled on:
 Google LastPass Dreamhost Outlook.com Facebook Dropbox DigitalOcean  Facebook also can generate two-factor codes from within the app. It&amp;rsquo;s the same TOTP method though.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: Since the writing of this post I have switched to Bitwarden for a variety of reasons. Most notably due to their fully open source approach and support for U2F as a second factor.
 This is a brief description of my security practices. I will make several posts and write updates as I make changes.
Password Management For password mangement I use LastPass. LastPass has its issues, however it is, in my opinion, the best balance of convenice and security.</description>

Servers I keep my data on a server running NAS4Free with one drive of parity. I also have servers running as VMs on a server running KVM and WebVirtMgr.

      <description>This is a brief description of my security practices. I will make several posts and write updates as I make changes.
Client Devices The main security measure I take on my individual devices is to use full disk encryption and not allow anyone else to use the device (unless there is a guest account).
 On Macs I enable FileVault On Windows I use BitLocker On iOS I enable TouchID/password which encrpyts the device On Android I use the Encrypt Phone feature  I also install only necessary software, and do regular wipe and resintalls of the OS.</description>

      <description>Overview This is an outline for a project I&amp;rsquo;m working on. I&amp;rsquo;ll post updates as I progress.
Golden Gate aims to be a transparent reverse proxy that sits on the border of a network. It will handle all web requests coming into the newtork and pass them to the appropriate server. Except for Golden Gate, nothing will be open to the Internet in general.
