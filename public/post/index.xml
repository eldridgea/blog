      <description>Every few months or years it seems like there’s at least a few news cycles devoted to how Artificial Intelligence is an existential threat to humanity.
Sometimes it’s a general warning from Stephen Hawking, or Elon Musk founding a new company. Pop culture also makes sapient AIs into the villian in things like I, Robot; Terminator; Age of Ultron; or even in media aimed more at family and young children like WALL-E.</description>

      <title>The Mental Health Treatment Obstacle Course</title>

      <description>So I got diagnosed with depression last year. I wasn’t happy about it (I mean, that’s obvious — that was the problem) but I knew it was one of the most common mental illnesses so I expected getting and executing a treatment plan would be frustrating but straightforward. I was extremely wrong.
First, I took a decent amount of time just coming to terms with the fact I might need some help.</description>

      <title>Free Speech and Antitrust</title>

      <description>Fairly regularly there’s a public discussion on free speech and the first amendment. There’s one happening now and I want to talk about these components and how they are similar or different and what roles they play, and why antitrust should be a part of these exact conversations. Antitrust is often a part of a separate conversation as it’s a completely different area of law. However in the area of large tech companies, antitrust is inextricable from the others.</description>

      <description>I’ve always been interested in business and the stock market. Like many people I’m aware that almost no one can beat the market reliably. So I have almost exclusively invested using index funds and roboadvisors with the only exception being equity I receive from a company where I work. Although even that I tend to sell and move to index funds eventually.
Even though I know the odds, I still like to think I can beat the market (don’t we all).</description>

      <description>I made a password change tool to keep your user password and encrypted boot password the same on Linux and made it available on GitHub.
I recently swapped to an Ubuntu Linux laptop as my main machine and wanted to make my boot and user login passwords the same as this would be a one-user machine. This was one thing I missed about my Mac, the boot experience where my boot password was the same as my user password and I was auto-logged in after booting but still had a password if I locked my screen.</description>

      <description>A recurring segment where I make predictions and check on my previous ones.
1. Square Will Being Disrupting/Circumventing the Visa &amp;amp; MasterCard Duopoly An overwhelming amount of consumer transactions are processed through wither MasterCard or Visa&amp;rsquo;s payment processing networks, whether the consumer is using debit or credit cards. The 2-3% fees on every transaction is where they make all their money. Square recognized that being able to accept debit/credit cards was a large overhead for sole proprietors and smaller shops, not only that but they weren&amp;rsquo;t very mobile.</description>

      <description>And now the whole machine, which whirred away so quietly that people had forgotten that it was a machine at all and thought it was just the way the world worked, had given a lurch.
– Terry Pratchett, “Feet of Clay”
This quote has been stuck in my head ever since public companies pulled out of Georgia at an astonishing rate in response to their new restrictive voter laws. These moves came soon after companies committed to pulling funding from Senators who challenged the results of the 2020 Presidential election.</description>

      <description>Recently I read The Art of Thinking Clearly. I enjoyed it and one of my takeaways was we tend to remember the true predictions we made, but don’t remember our incorrect predictions or justify some external reason why we were wrong. A good way to check some of my biases is to regularly write my predictions and revisit them later to see how well I did. So I’m going to try and do that weekly from now on.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: I now have volume control working with some help from CEC-O-Matic. I&amp;rsquo;ve added one file and updated the relevant code snippets below.
I have a TV in my bedroom with a soundbar, and I like to sleep with whitenoise on, but light from the TV screen keeps me awake. I’ve been using a phone app, but this week I decided to use a Raspberry Pi 0W to automate turning on just the soundbar, turning on some whitenoise, and being able to remote control that with my Home Assistant installation.</description>

      <title>Discussions of Signal SVR Should Consider Network Effects </title>

      <description>There is currently a lot of discussion around Signal’s new PIN decisions. In particular, the discussions have focused on the decision to use the PIN as a seed to encrypt backup data that will be stored on Signal servers using Secure Value Recovery (SVR). So user data will be stored in a way so that even Signal cannot access it. SVR uses Intel SGX to ensure this.
This week there was an excellent post by Matthew Green, a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University, where he discussed some of the concerns he has with Signal’s SVR system, especially around SGX.</description>

      <title>Dnsonward: Moving to encrypted DNS</title>
      <link>/2020/03/27/dnsonward-moving-to-encrypted-dns/</link>

      <description>Encrypted DNS is an improvement to end-user privacy and security. While there are occasionally trade offs to consider especially in enterprises, for home users, moving to encrypted DNS is almost universally an improvement. It closes huge privacy gaps and prevents ISPs from harvesting user data from DNS queries. (Currently that information can also be harvested from TLS headers but that gap will be closed too as connections move to using encrypted SNI in TLS 1.</description>

      <description>Many words have been spilled covering open office floor plans and the problems they present to both employees and employers. I’m not going to rehash the main points that have been covered many times, but wanted to point to a conclusion I’ve reached particularly relevant in my career &amp;ndash; open office floor plans tend to inhibit effective remote work.
Despite many pieces covering the downsides of an open office configuration, a recurring positive point is the encouragement of collaboration and interaction.</description>

      <description>I’ve recently been trying to reduce unnecessary power usage in my home. I have some ongoing projects which are pretty common: check to make sure heat isn’t escaping through poor insulation, replace bulbs with LED ones, set thermostat rules, etc. Something that caught my eye recently was standby power, and I decided to combine it with my existing presence detection with Home Assistant.
Standby power from devices such as TVs and sound systems is generally relatively low.</description>

      <description>I recently was on the hunt for a new laptop, and after over a decade of *nix/macOS laptops, decided to go with Windows 10 on a Surface Pro 7. Even with my daily workflow still being heavily Linux based, between the Surface line’s hardware, WSL, and the new Windows Terminal it was the perfect balance for what I needed.
My laptop search began after a brief stint with a Pixel Slate.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m open sourcing an app Workdown &amp;ndash; you write Markdown and it will be converted to a site, uploaded, and hosted on Cloudflare Workers.
On occasion I run into situations where I want to spin up a site relatively quickly, and I want a (mostly) static site. After all, static is fast! Generally I use Hugo and Netlify for these things, but using Cloudflare Workers on a few projects recently made be want to write Markdown and have it served directly from Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s edge.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m open sourcing a shortlink project I&amp;rsquo;m calling Lil Link that runs entirely on Cloudflare Workers.
At every company where I&amp;rsquo;ve worked, there has always been a &amp;ldquo;go link&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;shortlink&amp;rdquo; system. As there aren&amp;rsquo;t many modern and maintained open source systems, this tends to get reimplemented a lot. In fact, as an employee, I wrote the shortlink system that Cloudflare itself used (and may still use) in AppEngine before Workers was a product.</description>

      <description>Overview My home AT&amp;amp;T fiber goes down on rare occasion. Overall the reliability is pretty high but I wanted to have a failover just in case. This is my home Internet connection &amp;ndash; it runs some services, but nothing crucial. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend a lot of money on this. I have a password for Xfinity WiFi and my neighbors have an Xfinity hotspot so I decided I wanted to use this.</description>

      <description>Android 9.0 introduced native suppport for DNS over TLS (DoT). I like blocking ads and trackers on my device, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like rooting or using an always-on VPN. I begain investigating using DoT as a method for adblocking, as Android uses DoT for all DNS requests if it&amp;rsquo;s enabled. I used a combination of off-the-shelf stuff in a docker network to handle this.
The incoming DoT request is handled by Caddy which strips the TLS and forwards it as a standard DNS request within the private Docker network to a container running PiHole.</description>

      <description>We measure the economy wrong.
Well, maybe not wrong, but the way we measure the economy is increasingly irrelevant to the day-to-day lives of citizens when attempting to measure positive effects.
If it&amp;rsquo;s reported that &amp;ldquo;the economy&amp;rdquo; is getting worse, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably notice the effects in your personal life. If it&amp;rsquo;s reported that &amp;ldquo;the economy&amp;rdquo; is getting better, you may not be as directly affected.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how we measure the economy today.</description>

      <description>I wanted to take a moment and respond to Troy Hunt’s recent post Here&amp;rsquo;s Why [Insert Thing Here] Is Not a Password Killer.
First, I’d like to say that overall I am in strong agreement with the premise of the article. Usability, adoption, and lack of friction are all-important when considering a security mechanism, especially something as crucial as authentication, and when considering replacing something as well known as passwords. Not much out there addresses all of these things at once.</description>

I spoke about the effects of outside influences that are increasing how much they affect universites, and how that in turn is affecting students, professors, and administrators. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to see it, the stream is available on YouTube and I&amp;rsquo;ve made the slides available here. I&amp;rsquo;ve also embedded both below.</description>

I recently changed home ISPs and my new one doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer a free static IP. I run several services out of my lab at home. I&amp;rsquo;m the only person that really uses any of the services–definitely not a crucial setup with a 99.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with asymmetric or public key cryptography, a good introduction without the math is available here.
In the wake of the Equifax breach, there&amp;rsquo;s increasing discussion about making changes to Social Security Numbers. Any changes will need to be discussed and will take a long time to implement, but the discussion is overdue. I doubt that there will be any perfect solutions for a while, but the discussion is important.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to having freeipa-client available in dnf or apt repos, so I&amp;rsquo;ve rarely setup clients manually. However, I did today in Raspbian on my Raspberry Pi. I wanted to document it here mainly for my own memory. It was extremely straightforward but there were a couple tweaks needed. (In this doc &amp;ldquo;example.com&amp;rdquo; replaces my domain).
On the Pi install sssd, libnss-sss, libpam-sss, openssh-server krb5-user, and krb5-config.

I wanted to completely remove local login options, but this presented a minor problem - I wanted to make sure that if my LDAP server was down for any reason, I would still be able to access and troubleshoot priority systems. I login to systems via certificate but my sudo commands now require LDAP.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a prevailing myth in popular culture and the tech industry (and others I&amp;rsquo;m sure) of the &amp;ldquo;Necessary Jerk&amp;rdquo; - a jerk who is so singularly gifted in their field that they&amp;rsquo;re completely irreplaceable.
There are numerous examples spread across TV, movies, and books: Gregory House, Tony Stark, Sherlock Holmes, Shawn Spencer, and Granny Weatherwax to name a few.
While it is entertaining to watch Benedict Cumberbatch berate a bewildered Martin Freeman, or Hugh Laurie prank Lisa Edelstein, this prevalent “Necessary Jerk” persona seems to contribute to the collective belief that we have to hire or accommodate these people in the workplace simply because they are providing a unique service.</description>

      <description>I am a fairly heavy user of ChromeOS. Most of my &amp;ldquo;actual work&amp;rdquo; is done on my server so ChromeOS makes for a great laptop OS for me. However it is not compatible with my &amp;ldquo;Golden Gate&amp;rdquo; SSH setup as the Secure Shell extension for Chrome does not support ProxyCommand. There is a relay option that is used internally at Google that is unfortunately not open sourced.

      <description>I would like my videos to be ready to be moved to mobile devices when I want to travel, and things like Plex take too long for my liking. However I also prefer retaining the original full quality videos.
I wrote a Bash script (intended to be run as a cron job) that watches a directory for new files, and converts them to a ~3GB file with ffmpeg and dumps them in a destination directory.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make everything I do online as secure as possible, while compromizing my expereince as little as possible. The most significant choice here is my web browser.
I rotate between a lot of them because none of the realistic options I&amp;rsquo;ve found meet all of my requirements.
Requirements: Open source Tab sandboxing Supports Privacy Badger, uBlock, and HTTPS Everywhere (or equivalent feature set) Preferred: Automatic updates Cross platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android) U2F support LastPass support So, Chromium meets my security requirements, but it&amp;rsquo;s unrealistic for a few reasons:</description>

      <description>In addition to my Golden Gate proxy providing security for web requests, I needed it to assist in securing SSH requests as well. SSH is already as secure as I need it, but I wanted to avoid exposing my servers directly to the Internet.
For my internal services I added this to the ~/.ssh/config file on my laptop (replace USERNAME and PROXY_IP as appropriate):
Host *.naphos.com User USERNAME ProxyJump USERNAME@PROXY_IP ProxyJump is a relatively new SSH option, so if you find that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for you, you can use the ProxyCommand option:</description>

      <description>I have a rudimenatry Golden Gate proxy up and running using nginx reverse proxies. I have included the configuration file (from /etc/nginx/sites-enabled) I used to protect my Sickbeard installation.
The first server section forces a redirect from an http connection to an https one.
The second server section listens for https connections using the certificates declared. I didn&amp;rsquo;t use signed certificates as I am the only person that uses most of the services I host.</description>

      <description>Update: I have now switched from TT-RSS to Feedly
I&amp;rsquo;ve had people ask to get all my RSS Feeds. I have a bunch that I check in Tiny Tiny RSS. I&amp;rsquo;ve exported an OPML file that can be imported into Tiny Tiny RSS, or other readers.
You can grab it here.
This is mainly technology related feeds, but it also has tons of other stuff in it. You may want to sanitize inputs before blindly importing this.</description>

      <title>Security Measures: Two-Factor</title>

      <guid>/2014/12/30/security-measures-two-factor/</guid>
      <description>This is a brief description of my security practices. I will make several posts and write updates as I make changes.
Two-Factor Authentication I enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. I use multiple apps to do this, but I usually use Google Authenticator&amp;rsquo;s TOTP. I have this enabled on:
Google LastPass Dreamhost Outlook.com Facebook Dropbox DigitalOcean Facebook also can generate two-factor codes from within the app. It&amp;rsquo;s the same TOTP method though.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: Since the writing of this post I have switched to Bitwarden for a variety of reasons. Most notably due to their fully open source approach and support for U2F as a second factor.
This is a brief description of my security practices. I will make several posts and write updates as I make changes.
Password Management For password mangement I use LastPass. LastPass has its issues, however it is, in my opinion, the best balance of convenice and security.</description>

      <description>This is a brief description of my security practices. I will make several posts and write updates as I make changes.
Servers I keep my data on a server running NAS4Free with one drive of parity. I also have servers running as VMs on a server running KVM and WebVirtMgr.
On my NAS I only connect via encrypted methods such as AFP and SSH On my next upgrade, I will have my NAS encrypt on disk I only connect remotely to any of my servers/NAS via SSH or HTTPS Photo Credit: https://www.</description>

      <description>This is a brief description of my security practices. I will make several posts and write updates as I make changes.
Client Devices The main security measure I take on my individual devices is to use full disk encryption and not allow anyone else to use the device (unless there is a guest account).
On Macs I enable FileVault On Windows I use BitLocker On iOS I enable TouchID/password which encrpyts the device On Android I use the Encrypt Phone feature I also install only necessary software, and do regular wipe and resintalls of the OS.</description>

      <description>Overview This is an outline for a project I&amp;rsquo;m working on. I&amp;rsquo;ll post updates as I progress.
Golden Gate aims to be a transparent reverse proxy that sits on the border of a network. It will handle all web requests coming into the newtork and pass them to the appropriate server. Except for Golden Gate, nothing will be open to the Internet in general.
Golden Gate aims to provide
Security SSL Configuration Virtual hosts/subdomain management Centeralized Authentication Kerberos Two factor authentication Technologies nginx reverse proxy Python/Django for web management iptables/ufw for internal security Resources http://wiki.</description>
