      <description>I am a fairly heavy user of ChromeOS. Most of my &amp;ldquo;actual work&amp;rdquo; is done on my server so ChromeOS makes for a great laptop OS for me. However it is not compatible with my &amp;ldquo;Golden Gate&amp;rdquo; SSH setup as the Secure Shell extension for Chrome does not support ProxyCommand. There is a relay option that is used internally at Google that is unfortunately not open sourced.
However, I was able to find a reverse engineered relay server.</description>
